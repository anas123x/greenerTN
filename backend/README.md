GreenerTn is a RESTful API based on a non-relational database, main functionalities are: carbon tracking and notifications system. The main idea of this API is to track carbon emissions from cars using user's input about daily miles and information about the car, this API assesses the cars conditions and use the miles input to calculate average carbon consumption using a specific formula and returns notifications about average consumption and alternative transportation options. (version 1 depends solely on user's willingness to enter miles travelled in a day, next version will read directly from user's odometer and it also solely depends on the toyota camry CO2 emissions formula next version wil deal with different cars with their differnt fuel burning rates)
